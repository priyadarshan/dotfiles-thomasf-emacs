Getting started.
----------------

Find a recipe that you enjoy. For the purpose of this I will use a
"Molasses cookies" recipe from Here in Americaâ€™s test kitchen,
p. 275. Open a new ``.org`` file in Emacs, e.g. ``recipes.org``.

Enter your recipe title::

  * Molasses spice cookies

Now we want to add the ingredients and description. I like to mix the
two up. Here is an example::

  Whisk together:
  - 2.25 cup ($11.25 oz$) flour
  - 1 tsp baking soda
  - 1.5 tsp ground cinnamon
  - 1.5 tsp ground ginger
  - .5 tsp ground cloves
  - .25 tsp ground allspice
  - .25 tsp ground pepper
  -. 25 tsp salt

  Beat at med high until light and fluffy (~3 min):
  - 12 tbsp butter, softened
  - 1/2 cup sugar

  Reduce speed to med low, add:
  - 1 egg yolk
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract

  Increase speed to med, beat until incorporated (~20 sec). Reduce speed
  to med low, add:

  - 2/3 cup molasses

  Beat ~20 sec. Reduce speed to low, add:
  - flour mixture (above)

  Roll into 1.25 in balls. Roll balls in:
  - turbinado sugar

  Bake for 11 min at 375 degF.

When writing ingredients, use the form::

  - n unit ingredient

Note that fractional (1/4) ingredients must be entered using as n:m
(e.g. ``1:4``, not ``1/4``). Keep units singular (``2 cup``) rather than plural (``2
cups``).

With the cursor inside the recipe, we can convert to metric
units. Type::

  M-x org-cook-toggle-recipe-units

All the units in the recipe should be converted to metric. Repeat the
operation to convert back. Notice that while we attempt to get the
best unit possible, sometimes it does not work as well as it might. To
convert an individual line to your preferred unit, navigate to the
line and type::

  M-x org-cook-convert-ingedient-units-at-point

Then select your preferred unit from the list. Note also that we may
end up with funny numbers (.248 rather than .25) due to rounding
problems.

To view only the ingredients, use::

  M-x org-cook-show-ingredients-only
